# Project Documentation

This repository contains documentation for project Ocr_application, which includes Jupyter notebooks for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using various OCR libraries. The documentation is organized as follows:

## OCR Notebooks

### General Description

The notebooks in this project focus on text recognition in documents using different OCR libraries such as Tesseract OCR, Keras OCR, Paddle OCR, Doctr TR, and Easy OCR. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific OCR library.

### Specific Content

#### Tesseract OCR Notebook

- **Description:** Uses Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
- **Content:** Image loading, image preprocessing, text recognition, and displaying results.

#### Keras OCR Notebook

- **Description:** Uses Keras OCR for text recognition.
- **Content:** PDF to image conversion, image preprocessing, OCR recognition, displaying, and exporting results.

#### Paddle OCR Notebook

- **Description:** Uses Paddle OCR for text recognition and layout detection.
- **Content:** Image loading, image cropping, layout detection, text recognition, and displaying results.

#### Doctr TR Notebook

- **Description:** Uses Doctr TR for text recognition in documents.
- **Content:** Image loading, image preprocessing, text detection, text recognition, and displaying results.

#### Easy OCR Notebook

- **Description:** Uses Easy OCR for multilingual text recognition.
- **Content:** PDF to image conversion, image preprocessing, text recognition, and displaying results.

### How to Use

Each notebook can be executed by installing the necessary libraries and specifying the path to the image or PDF you want to process in the code specific to each OCR library.
